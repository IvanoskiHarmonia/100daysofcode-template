## How To Download

  
  

### no Git Bash

  
  

The easiest and most reliable to download this without Git Bash is:

  

- Right above where all the files are located you will see ```Code``` button right next to the buttons ```Go to file``` and ```Add file```, press it, then ```Download ZIP``` will appear at the bottom of the small window, click that and it will download the files into your downloads folder on your local machine.
  
 
 

### Git Bash

  
  

If you have installed ```Git Bash```, by now I would guess that you already know at least a little bit about programming, and how to use it, so in that case:


``` git clone https://github.com/IvanoskiHarmonia/100daysofcode-template ```

## Populate

  

The only thing you need to change in the code is the ```day you started```, this section can be found the js file that is found in: ```src -> script.js```, and with pressing CTRL+F when in the file type: ```Below: Please change this to the date you started``` and then just change the date you started with the date that is below this comment.

## Usage

  

### Start and Stop buttons


This are self explanatory, but when you press the start button you will get the time that you started and that time will be saved in the Start field, same with stop. Later when you press the Crate Layout the times will be copied into the Layout Textarea.


The reviewed and learning textareas are basically what they say, the things you reviewed today and the things you learned/worked on


Last but not least, press the Create layout button to create the layout with the day which you are on, and the times of start and stopped, plus the reviewed and learning fields.
